title: Happy New Year :) Bye Bye 2016
---

A wonderful awesome year 2016 and awesomatic year 2017 ahead.

This is my first personal blog, and I'm very happy to share my happiness of year 2016. In 2016, i had both success and failure, which taugh me many important things. Had a big curve of up and down all my life, but the year 2016 is very special.

Started using Google more efficiently,..
I had opportunity to search and learn something about Machine learning, DevOps, Automation Process, Groovy... Hahaha... Indian and World Politics, Social media, Fidel Castro, Syria Crisis, Qatar Cruelty, Burma Muslim killing, Jallikattu, UPI,... Elon Musk, SpaceX, Mission Mars, Theory of Relativity, GOD, Gravity... On the whole got addicted to :)

And my learning curve didn't stop here,
I got married in 2016 and started learning about my wife's mind :) A Complex subject ;)... But A very happy married life. Some say marriage's are made in heaven, and it really happened for me.

I came out of my workaholic obsession and started spending time for myself and my family.

I have learned, sometime we should not answer. Why?? Because... Better to keep mmmm.. than to answer a stupid question and to a stupid person ;)

Had some flops in 2016, many bad days including flood and cyclone in Chennai.

In 2016 i have reduced using Facebook and started using Twitter, which is much much better and good social media. Most of all Twitter has less troll memes.

I have reduced sharing of useless, wrongly directed and fake information, which now a days so popular in social media. Started analysing the content i read in Social media before sharing it to friends, but its really hard to find a fake or original content.

I have started paying my complete Income Tax ;) (As a Kamal Haasan Fan).

I have learned that being yourself is always good than to predent to be someone else. This gave me lot confidence in making decisions and believing myself, even if people say I'm so foolish.

Blaming others will not provide you much positive attitude so I reduced doing so and started focusing on solutions.

Remembering your past is always good, which gives you more satisfaction and many times big motivation from your experience for the days to come.

Before every New year, at the end of each year, i remember to recollect my past year, which motivates me big time and Knock Knock me "Never Give Up" :P :)

Happy New Year!!!
