My blog is not to promote any content or person. I like to share my thoughts and experience which may help or motivate someone. I too like to read your (others) feedback and self experiences to get positive motivation. The sharing point of views is decreasing day by day. In India only ~60% (vote) say yes, no or none other 40% never share anything. Blogging may help increasing the percentage of people sharing their knowledge and experience. So start blogging :)
